# enactus

The main project I performed as the final project of the course was Enactus AAST Sheraton APP that enable members in enactus teams to connect with their president, Heads and HRs.
This app provides many useful options:

•	Each team head can send feedbacks to the members in his team every week.
•	Each team member can send feedbacks to his head with anonymous identity, so the head cannot recognize the sender.
•	Each user has an account that displays user’s team name, position in the team, feedbacks sent to him from others, score and rank between other users.
•	Each president, Head, HR can create posts, but ordinary members cannot
•	Notifications to notify a specific user with feedback sent to him, or to notify all users with a post created.
•	Each team head can set score and rank to each member.
•	Display each team with its members.
